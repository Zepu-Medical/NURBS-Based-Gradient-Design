Add "Functions" folder to the path
1. In the step0 folder, run wire_fitting.m to fit the point series and save it in NURBS_curve_ini.mat. The point series is located in Coil2D_ini.mat.
2. Run NURBS_wire_optimization_phase2 for optimization. After iterating a specific number of times, modify XX in coeff_opt=glo_coeff{XX}, then run this section.
3. The design will be drawn and saved in Coil2D_final.mat. The results of the iteration are saved in coeff_iter.mat.
4. Copy "Coil2D_final.mat" to the next step's folder and rename it as "Coil2D_ini.mat", and return to step 1.
